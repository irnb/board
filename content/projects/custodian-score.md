incentivise users to check the proof of inclusion in the proof of liability (maybe with token or reputation )

Can custodians stake to promise that liabilities are correct? If a user proves theyâ€™re not included then the stake will get slashed. (for doing this the custodian should commit to the snapshot in somehow and the user was wiling to disclose he amount or we can sole it with zkp too)

This may not be the exact answer you're expecting, but if we add a challenge punishment system for the slashing, it would likely result in the user always being on the losing side, similar to a challenge game in Plasma. This is primarily due to issues with data availability.
