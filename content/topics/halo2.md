3 parts
Arithmetization (convert constraints to polynomials)
Commitment scheme (construct commitments to those polynomials)
Accumulation schemes (efficiently combine opening proofs)

EC is Homomorphic under addition 

If we have Homomorphic for addition and multiplication we call that protocol Fully Homomorphic

Paring on EC gave us Multiplication verification ability


This is a significantly cooler way to introduce ZKP to someone than using the color blind example.
